------=_Part_167_30861371.1346982403380
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

version : 2.0.5
Replica set (slaveOk = disabled)

This is the primary log, where we can clearly see, that suddenly the read 
queries stopped coming(logging).  
http://pastebin.com/VLciscv7

At the same time, mongo-java-client reporting timeOut exception : 
http://pastebin.com/CB7hEced
Also this is not the fact that queries took more time. The queries hardly 
take 100 ms. Also total number of open_sockets in that mongod server box 
bounces from 20-600 because the process is not responding.


Also, I was not allowed to login to this mongo via the mongo-shell. The 
process running was totally unresponsive. I was not able to normally stop 
the process. Ultimately I have to do kill -9.
This had happened some 5-6 times with different servers(sometimes on 
primaries and secondary) last 1 week. And at that time I just have to force 
kill that process and then restart.

Please someone explain me the reason.
Let me know if some more log information is required.
