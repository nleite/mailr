Hi Tetlika,

This very much sounds as if your system is paging at the time you are=20
seeing these spikes.

The spike in resident memory correlating with a spike in I/O Wait sounds=20
like your instance is trying to pull paged files from disk into memory.

In MMS we capture this metric explicitly.=20

Common solutions here are to look at faster disks or increase the amount of=
=20
ram available to your server.

Cheers,

David
