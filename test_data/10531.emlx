Hi David,

As you noted, skipping(in combination with limit and an index of some kind) 
is one possible solution for pagination: It allows you to skip past the 
first n documents (those on previous pages, presumably) to get those 
documents that are needed for the current page.  Personally this solution 
seems very good to me, it seems like a very good usage of skip from what I 
can tell.

Just to clarify what you are asking: You would like to do a range query on 
OIDs, getting all documents with an OID less than (or greater than) a 
specific OID (corresponding to the start document).  The results of this 
query should then be sorted in natural order.

It is important to note that unless this is a capped collection the natural 
ordering is not necessarily the same as the insertion order.  This 
guarantee is only provided for capped collections.  See 
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sorting+and+Natural+Order for some more 
info.  

Another important note is that natural ordering is not the same as the OID 
ordering.  Thus if you want pagination based on OIDs you do not want to be 
sorting/ordering your results based on the natural ordering of the 
documents.

That being said, if I understood your problem correctly, here are the steps 
to a possible solution:

1) Get the OID for the "start" document

2) Do a query using the $lt (or $gt (see 
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operators/#_S_lt for more info)) 
operators to find the relevant OIDs in this collection

3) Do a sort on the results of 2) using the natural ordering 

4 (optional)) Use the limit (see 
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-%7B%7Blimit%28%29%7D%7D 
for more info) to get the next n results, where n is the number of results 
your want on your page

Hopefully this will help point you in the right direction.  If you have any 
more questions feel free to ask!

-Andrew
